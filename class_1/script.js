// Variables in JS,  we can use them to store data, they can change values
// To create Variable we use let (prefix) name (name of variable) = "" (values for created variable, "" use only for array-text)


let name = "Milos";
let surname = "Nikolic";

// To execute js, we need to connect .js file with .html. Add script inside the body tag
// Always use CONSOLE in browser for js testing
// For script testing in console, use instruction  console.log(); if everything is fine it will show values for created variables if we use variable name, or plain text instead


console.log(name, surname);



//  Test 1.  Make two variables, myName and  age then use Console log to execute "Hi my name is "name", and i am "age" old.

let myName = "Milos";
let age = 36;

console.log("Hi, my name is " + myName, "and i am " + age, "years old");  // Test successfully passed in Console
